xdg-open diagram.html  # Linux
```

**Option 2: Online editor**
1. Copy `diagram.mmd` content

**Option 3: VS Code**
1. Install extension: "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support"
2. Open `diagram.mmd`
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+V` (macOS) for preview

**Option 4: GitHub**

## 📚 Documentation

### Core Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Comprehensive guide with:
  - Repository structure and skill organization
  - Task hierarchy (Epic → Story → Task)
  - Development principles (KISS/YAGNI/DRY, Standards First, Risk-Based Testing)
  - Complete workflow documentation for all skills
  - Template references and best practices
  - Linear integration details

### Skill Structure

Each skill follows a unified structure:
```
x-skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Metadata and full description
├── diagram.mmd           # Mermaid workflow diagram
├── diagram.html          # Standalone HTML viewer
└── references/           # Templates and guides
    ├── template.md       # Document templates
    └── guide.md          # Reference guides
```

### Template Ownership Principle

- Each skill owns its templates in its own `references/` directory (Single Source of Truth)
- Templates are NOT copied to project during setup
- Skills use templates directly from their `references/` when generating documents
- Example: x-adr-creator uses `x-adr-creator/references/adr_template.md` when creating ADRs

## 🌟 Key Concepts

### Task Hierarchy
```
Epic (Linear Project)
  └── User Story (Linear Issue with label "user-story")
      └── Task (Linear Issue with parentId=Story ID)
          └── Subtask (implementation steps)
```

### Development Principles

**Hierarchy of Principles (when conflicts arise):**
1. **Industry Standards & RFCs** (OAuth 2.0, REST API design, OpenAPI, protocol standards)
2. **Security Standards** (OWASP Top 10, NIST guidelines)
3. **Development Principles** (KISS/YAGNI/DRY apply WITHIN standard boundaries)

**Core Principles:**
- **Standards First** - Follow industry standards before applying KISS/YAGNI
- **YAGNI** - Do not add functionality ahead of time
- **KISS** - Simplest solution that works (within standard boundaries)
- **DRY** - Do not duplicate code
- **Consumer-First** - Consumer first (API endpoint), then provider (Repository)
- **Task Granularity** - Optimal task size 3-5 hours (max 6 tasks per Story)
- **Value-Based Testing** - Prioritize by business risk (2-5 E2E, 3-8 Integration, 5-15 Unit per Story)
- **No Legacy Code** - Remove backward compatibility shims and deprecated patterns
