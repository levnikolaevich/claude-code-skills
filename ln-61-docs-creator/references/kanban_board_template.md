## Linear Configuration (use MCP Linear)

**What is Linear:** Issue tracking and project management tool with workspace → initiative → project → issue hierarchy.

**Our Configuration:**
- **Workspace**: [TEAM_NAME] ([WORKSPACE_URL])
- **Team**: [TEAM_NAME] (Team Key: [TEAM_KEY])
- **Initiative**: [Your Initiative Name]
- **Projects**: Each Epic = separate Linear Project
- **Issues**: User Stories (label:user-story, parentId=null) + Tasks (parentId=StoryId)

**Key Features:**
- Custom views replicate kanban workflow (Backlog → Active → Review → Done)
- Labels for technical categorization (db, api, service, testing)
- Issue titles preserve Epic context (EP{N}_{XX}: Task Name)
- Single source of truth for all task tracking

**Detailed Guide:** See [docs/guides/25-linear-task-management.md](../guides/25-linear-task-management.md) for:
- Hierarchical structure and best practices
- Custom views, labels, and workflow patterns
- Team keyboard shortcuts and bulk actions

**Single Source of Truth for all Linear variables**

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Team ID** | [TEAM_NAME] | Linear team name |
| **Team UUID** | [TEAM_UUID] | Team UUID for API calls |
| **Team Key** | [TEAM_KEY] | Short key for issues ([TEAM_KEY]-XX) |
| **Workspace URL** | [WORKSPACE_URL] | Linear workspace |
| **Next Epic Number** | 1 | Next available Epic number |

## Quick Access

**Views:**
- [Backlog]([WORKSPACE_URL]/team/[TEAM_KEY]/backlog)
- [Todo]([WORKSPACE_URL]/team/[TEAM_KEY])
- [Active Sprint]([WORKSPACE_URL]/team/[TEAM_KEY]/active)
- [All Issues]([WORKSPACE_URL]/team/[TEAM_KEY]/all)

### Epic Story Counters

| Epic | Last Story | Next Story | Last Task | Next Task |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Epic 0 | - | US001 | - | EP0_01 |
| Epic 1+ | - | US001 | - | EP1_01 |

**Note:** User Story numbering starts at US001 for each new Epic. Task numbering starts at EP{N}_01 where N is the Epic number. [TEAM_KEY]-XX numbers are auto-generated by Linear.
